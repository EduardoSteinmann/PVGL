# PVGL (Pyplot VEX Graphing Library)
A simple Python script meant to help visualize data from PID controllers for VEX robots.

# Instructions
The script uses the pyplot module from matplotlib to graph data from different loop iterations of PID controller. It prompts the user and asks them for the file in which the data is stored, which should be formatted with each line providing information from one iteration of the PID loop in the following format: "P-Value I-Value D-Value Error-Value". For clarification, see ExampleData.txt

# Dependencies
In order to run the script, matplotlib is required. Alternatively, if you are on Windows, you can simply use the released executable file.

# Feedback
I made this script to help my high school robotics club visualize data from the PID controllers we were programming, and in doing so, optimize the process of fine tuning our PID adjustments. I hope that this script helps you as well, and any feedback or ideas would be appreciated. Thank you!
